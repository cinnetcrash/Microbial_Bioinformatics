                  <h2>Hakkımda...</h2>
									<p>I graduated from the Ankara University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in June 2016. While studying veterinary medicine, I also worked part-time in medical diagnostic laboratories and in the pathology laboratory of my university. In this process, I gained a lot of information and experience about laboratory processes. In this process, I tried to continue the studies aimed at increasing the knowledge and experience I gained until the completion of my university life. In addition, before graduating from university, I spent time in the Microbiology laboratory in my spare time and gained basic knowledge about molecular microbiology.
                  <p>After graduating from university, I started my master's degree at Ankara University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Microbiology. In this process, I carried out studies on a Tübitak 1003 project, a BAP project (which I wrote with my advisor), and many scientific projects.</p>
                  <p>Before graduating from the master's program, I started to work as an application specialist in Bioeksen R&D technology company. During this 4,5-year-long job, I have been involved in many application and research projects at home and abroad. These studies, which are generally carried out for the detection of infectious agents, it was aimed to detect molecular biotechnological methods within local possibilities.</p>
                  <p>These studies are generally carried out by authorized COVID laboratories in Turkey (200), Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health, General Directorate of Public Health, Ankara University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (Different departments), Etlik Veterinary Control Institute, Avitek Ar-Ge Technologies, many private medical laboratories, food platoon commands of Turkish Armed Forces and in the laboratories of the University. I led the development project of the first PCR kit at the beginning of the pandemic period. Afterward, I took part in the coordination of the studies for the development of the first domestic kit and its approval by the FDA and WHO. I was involved in the development of the sequencing kit developed for the inclusion of Oxford nanopore systems in routine next-generation sequencing studies.</p>
                  <p>In 2019, I completed my master's studies in microbiology and earned the title of "Microbiology specialist". Afterward, I started my doctorate studies in microbiology again. In this process, I have been involved in many studies. Generally, these studies include studies on Molecular Epidemiology, diagnosis of infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, and fungi), bioinformatics, and development of diagnostic methods.</p>
